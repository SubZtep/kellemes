  {
    "question": "Is the Leo proton therapy room light or dark?",
    "answer": "The Leo proton therapy room is light most of the time but your medical team might dim the lights when they're getting you ready for treatment. When they dim the lights, it helps them see a special red or green light which helps them position you properly."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the side effects of proton therapy?",
    "answer": "Side effects of proton therapy depend on the part of the body being treated, the size of the tumour, and the types of healthy tissue near it. Proton therapy itself doesn't hurt but you might feel tired afterwards and maybe have some skin problems like: redness, dryness, irritation, swelling and occasionally some peeling or blistering. Sometimes there can be other side effects, especially if you're having chemotherapy too. If you have proton therapy your health and care team will be able to tell you which side effects you might feel."
  },
  {
    "question": "How close is the Leo proton therapy machine to you?",
    "answer": "Most of the time, the Leo proton therapy machine is far away from you, then, before treatment begins, a big hula hoop moves up and down around you to take special pictures, but it doesn't touch you. During treatment, part of the machine, shaped like a box, is programmed to move close to you but it automatically stops at a safe distance and it doesn't touch you. Your medical team is in control of the proton therapy machine all the time and they make sure it never touches you."

    "answer": "You are helped to stay still during proton therapy with special devices that keep your body in the right position. The medical team will make sure you're as comfortable as possible before the therapy starts. Play specialists have some brilliant ways of helping you stay still and they'll tell you the best ones depending on which part of the body is being treated. Sometimes you might be given some medicine to make you sleep through the treatment and you might be able to take a teddy with you to hold while it's happening. It's different for everyone."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will my mum be with me during proton therapy?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Will proton therapy hurt?",
    "answer": "Proton therapy itself doesn't hurt. Sometimes there are some side effects because of where on the body the treatment happens or the radiation dosage used, and it can feel a bit weird because of the position you have to be in during treatment. It's different for everyone though and the medical team are able to explain what might happen."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does proton therapy feel like?",
    "answer": "You shouldn't feel anything during proton therapy treatment."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do young children have an anaesthetic during proton therapy?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Does anything touch me during Leo proton therapy?",
    "answer": "When you have Leo proton therapy you will be sitting upright in a chair. Sometimes there'll be immobilisation devices in place to keep you in the best position. Other than those things, nothing else will touch you."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does anything touch me during proton therapy?",
    "answer": "When you have proton therapy you will be lying on a table, sometimes called a couch even though it doesn't look like a couch at home. There might be some immobilisation devices in place to help keep you in the best position. Other than those things, nothing else will touch you."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you need to wear a mask for Leo proton therapy on the chair?",
    "answer": "Not everyone needs to wear a mask during Leo proton therapy. They're mainly used for patients being treated for a tumour in the head, neck or eye. Masks are custom-made for each patient's face and sometimes they can decorate them too."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I ask questions after the proton therapy has started?",
    "answer": "You should ask any questions before treatment has started because talking can make you move and it's important to stay still. The medical team can hear and see you at all times so if it's urgent, you can be heard."
